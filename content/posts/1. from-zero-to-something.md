When first starting to build a project of any kind, the first few things that go right are huge wins.  Going from zero to something at all is an infinite improvement, and then things immediately start to slow down from there.

Some projects we take on are for pleasure, others for greed, others to just see if we can do it.

The project that I’m currently working on, [a database](https://github.com/jzombie/rust-llkv), I’ve lost track of exactly why I’m still working on it, but I’m committed to it, just to see if I can build it, even though I’ve got these _AI_ tools working alongside me many steps of the way.  Can _they_ build it?

So before I really dive into the details of this database, let me tell you a little bit about what to expect from this blog.

You see, it’s a learning journey for me, and as such, there’s going to be a lot of incorrect assumptions along the way, and I may be slightly embarrassed once I realize that I was wrong about a few things, but I will do my best to just keep going anyway.

Our lives are always some type of journey anyway. We never know what the future holds, and we’re always learning anyway.  So if we’re always learning, it’s safe to say that we are making some mistakes along the way.
