This blog is a builder's log for zenOSmosis: storage engines, databases, data tools, and the odd experiment that doesn't fit anywhere else.

You'll mostly see deep introspective dives, notes from testing, stuff that went drastically wrong, and the occasional win.

Less "launch announcement," more "here's what actually happened and why I kept going."

If you like seeing systems built in the open with numbers, tradeoffs, and occasional dead ends, you're in the right place.
